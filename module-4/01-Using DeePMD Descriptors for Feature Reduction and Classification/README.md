## Perform dimensional reduction and classification
In this notebook, you will:

Load and visualize atomic environment descriptors generated by DeePMD

Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction

Use machine learning classifiers to distinguish between different atomic environments (e.g., ice, water, interfacial water)

Evaluate model performance and interpret classification results
