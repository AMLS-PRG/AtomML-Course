# Trained Machine Learning Potentials (MLPs)

This folder contains **four trained machine learning potentials (MLPs)** as well as the **loss curve file (`lcurve.out`)** from the training process of one of the potentials.

## Contents

- `frozen_model_1_compressed.pb`, `frozen_model_2_compressed.pb`, `frozen_model_3_compressed.pb`, `frozen_model_4_compressed.pb`  
  ‚Üí Fully trained MLP models.

- `lcurve.out`  
  ‚Üí Training log file that records the evolution of the **loss function**, including the RMSE of energy and forces on both training and validation sets.

## üîç Loss Curve Visualization

To visualize the training loss evolution of the model:

These MLPs enable molecular dynamics simulations.
