ðŸ“˜ Section Introduction
In this section's hands-on example, we will demonstrate how to train a machine learning potential (MLP) using an initial dataset, perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by the trained MLP, and analyze the resulting trajectories. The workflow consists of the following steps:

Preparing the Initial Configuration and Labeling

Training MLPs Using a Multilayer Neural Network

MD Simulations Driven by the MLP

Analyzing the Trajectory from MD

By iteratively repeating steps 1 to 3, one can implement an active learning scheme to improve the MLP during the simulation process.
