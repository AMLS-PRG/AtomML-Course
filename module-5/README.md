# ðŸ“˜ Module 5 - Training ML Models for the Potential Energy Surface

In this section's hands-on example, we will demonstrate how to train a machine learning potential (MLP) using an initial dataset, perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by the trained MLP, and analyze the resulting trajectories.

The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. Preparing the Initial Configuration and Labeling
2. Training MLPs
3. Error Analysis
3. MD Simulations Driven by the MLP
4. Analyzing the Trajectory from MD

By iteratively repeating steps 1 to 3, one can implement an active learning scheme to improve the MLP during the simulation process.
