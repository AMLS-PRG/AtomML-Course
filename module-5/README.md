In this section's hands-on example, we will demonstrate how to train a machine learning potential (MLP) using an initial dataset, perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by the trained MLP, and analyze the resulting trajectories. The workflow consists of the following steps:

## 01-Preparing the Initial Configuration and Labeling

## 02-Training MLPs Using a Multilayer Neural Network

## 03-MD Simulations Driven by the MLP

## 04-Analyzing the Trajectory from MD

By iteratively repeating steps 01 to 03, one can implement an active learning scheme to improve the MLP during the simulation process.
